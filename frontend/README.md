# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Security feature

Implemented Features

User Identification System**

   * Automatically generate a unique ID for each user
   * Store the user ID in local storage to ensure session persistence
   * Display the user ID in the AppBar (partially masked for security)
User-Specific Scenario Separation**

   * **Default Scenarios**: Accessible to all users (Depression, Anxiety, Relationship Issues)
   * **Personal Scenarios**: Only visible to the user who created them
   * Add a `userId` field to scenarios to distinguish ownership

Scenario Management Functions**

   * **Create**: Allow users to create and save scenarios individually
   * **Read**: Display default scenarios + scenarios created by the current user
   * **Delete**: Only allow deletion of scenarios created by the current user
   * Visual distinction with a “My Scenarios” label and a delete button

Backend API Enhancements**

   * `POST /api/create-user`: Generate a new user ID
   * `POST /api/save-scenario`: Save a scenario with the associated user ID
   * `GET /api/scenarios?userId=xxx`: Retrieve scenarios for a specific user
   * `DELETE /api/scenarios/:id?userId=xxx`: Delete a scenario for a specific user

Frontend UI Improvements**

   * Add a delete button to scenario cards
   * Indicate user-specific scenarios
   * Use a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions
   * Display user information

Security and Privacy Protection**

   * Complete data isolation for each user
   * User identification based on local storage
   * No personal information stored on the server
